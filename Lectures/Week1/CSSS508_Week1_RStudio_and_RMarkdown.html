# Using the Mailing List

Don't ask like this:

&gt; tried lm(y~x) but it iddn't work wat do

--

Instead, ask like this: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
y &lt;- seq(1:10) + rnorm(10)
x &lt;- seq(0:10)
model &lt;- lm(y ~ x)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Running the block above gives me the following error, anyone know why?

&lt;pre&gt;
Error in model.frame.default(formula = y ~ x, 
drop.unused.levels = TRUE) : variable lengths differ 
(found for 'x')
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

# A Note on Slide Formatting

**Bold** usually indicates an important vocabulary term. These are terms to remember!

--

*Italics* indicate emphasis but also are used to point out thinks you must click with a mouse, for example: "Please click *File &gt; Print*"

--

`Code` usually represents R code you might type into the editor or console or keystrokes used to perform actions, for example: "Please press `Ctrl-P` to open the print dialogue."

--

Code chunks that span the page like the one below represent *actual R code that runs inside these slides*.


```r
*# Sometimes important stuff is highlighted!
7 * 49
```

```
## [1] 343
```

The lines preceded by `##` represent the output, or result, of running the code in the code chunk. We'll talk about this more later!

# R and RStudio


---

# Why R?

R is a programming language built for statistical computing.

If one already knows Stata or similar software, why use R?
--

* R is *free*, so you don't need a terminal server.
--

* R has a *very* large community.
--

* R can handle virtually any data format.
--

* R makes replication easy.
--

* R is a *language* so it can do *everything*.
--

* R is a good stepping stone to other languages like Python.

---

# R Studio

R Studio is a "front-end" or integrated development environment (IDE) for R that can make your life *easier*.

--

RStudio can:
--

* Organize your code, output, and plots.
--

* Auto-complete code and highlight syntax.
--

* Help view data and objects.
--

* Enable easy integration of R code into documents.

---

# Selling you on R Markdown

A killer feature of R/RStudio is ease of making R Markdown files:
--

* Document analysis as you go with integrated text, code, and output

--

  + No rerunning, recopying, or repasting
--

  + Easy for collaborators to understand
--

  + Show as little or as much of the code as you want
  
--

* Produce many different document types as output

--

  + PDF documents
  + HTML webpages and reports
  + Word documents 
  + Presentations (like these slides)

--

* Works with LaTeX for math and more formatting control

--

We'll get back to this shortly!

---

# Getting Started

Open up RStudio now and choose *File &gt; New File &gt; R Script*.

Then, let's get oriented with the interface:

* *Top Left*: Code **editor** pane, data viewer (browse with tabs)

* *Bottom Left*: **Console** for running code (`&gt;` prompt)

* *Top Right*: List of objects in **environment**, code **history** tab.

* *Bottom Right*: Tabs for browsing files, viewing plots, managing packages, and viewing help files.

You can change the layout in *Preferences &gt; Pane Layout*

---

# Editing and Running Code

There are several ways to run R code in RStudio:
--

* Highlight lines in the **editor** window and click *Run* at the top or hit `Ctrl+Enter` or `⌘+Enter` to run them all.

--

* With your **caret** on a line you want to run, hit `Ctrl+Enter` or `⌘+Enter`. Note your caret moves to the next line, so you can run code sequentially with repeated presses. 

--

* Type individual lines in the **console** and press `Enter`.

--

* In R Markdown documents, click within a code chunk and click the green arrow to run the chunk. The button beside that runs *all prior chunks*.

--

The console will show the lines you ran followed by any printed output.

---

# Incomplete Code

If you mess up (e.g. leave off a parenthesis), R might show a `+` sign prompting you to finish the command:


```r
&gt; (11-2
+
```

Finish the command or hit `Esc` to get out of this.

---

# R as a Calculator

In the **console**, type `123 + 456 + 789` and hit `Enter`.
--


```r
123 + 456 + 789
```

```
## [1] 1368
```

--

The `[1]` in the output indicates the numeric **index** of the first element on that line.

--

Now in your blank R document in the **editor**, try typing the line `sqrt(400)` and either
clicking *Run* or hitting `Ctrl+Enter` or `⌘+Enter`.

--


```r
sqrt(400)
```

```
## [1] 20
```

---

# Functions and Help

`sqrt()` is an example of a **function** in R.

If we didn't have a good guess as to what `sqrt()` will do, we can type `?sqrt` in the console
and look at the **Help** panel on the right.


```r
?sqrt
```

**Arguments** are the *inputs* to a function. In this case, the only argument to `sqrt()`
is `x` which can be a number or a vector of numbers.

Help files provide documentation on how to use functions and what functions produce.

---

# Creating Objects

R stores everything as an **object**, including data, functions, models, and output.

--

Creating an object can be done using the **assignment operator**: `&lt;-` 
--


```r
new.object &lt;- 144
```

--

**Operators** like `&lt;-` are functions that look like symbols but typically sit between their arguments 
(e.g. numbers or objects) instead of having them inside `()` like in `sqrt(x)`&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. 

.footnote[[1] We can actually call operators like other functions by stuffing them between backticks: &lt;code&gt;\`+\`(x,y)&lt;/code&gt;]

--

We do math with operators, e.g., `x + y`. `+` is the addition operator!

---

# Calling Objects

You can display or "call" an object simply by using its name.


```r
new.object
```

```
## [1] 144
```

Object names can contain `_` and `.` in them, but cannot *begin* with numbers. Try
to be consistent in naming objects. RStudio auto-complete means *long names are better 
than vague ones*! Good names&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; save confusion later.

.footnote[[1] "There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things." - Phil Karlton]

---

# Using Objects

An object's **name** represents the information stored in that **object**, so you can treat the object's name
as if it were the values stored inside.
--


```r
new.object + 10
```

```
## [1] 154
```

```r
new.object + new.object
```

```
## [1] 288
```

```r
sqrt(new.object)
```

```
## [1] 12
```

---

# Creating Vectors

A **vector** is a series of **elements**, such as numbers.

--

You can create a vector and store it as an object in the same way. To do this, use the
function `c()` which stands for "combine" or "concatenate".
--


```r
new.object &lt;- c(4, 9, 16, 25, 36)
new.object
```

```
## [1]  4  9 16 25 36
```

--

If you name an object the same name as an existing object, *it will overwrite it*.

--

You can provide a vector as an argument for many functions.
--


```r
sqrt(new.object)
```

```
## [1] 2 3 4 5 6
```

---

# More Complex Objects

The same principles can be used to create more complex objects like **matrices**, **arrays**, **lists**, and **dataframes** (lists which look like matrices but can hold multiple data types at once).

Most data sets you will work with will be read into R and stored as a **dataframe**, so this course will mainly focus on manipulating and visualizing these objects.

Before we get into these, let's revisit R Markdown.

---

# R Markdown

---

# R Markdown Documents

Let's try making an R Markdown file:

1. Choose *File &gt; New File &gt; R Markdown...*
2. Make sure *HTML Output* is selected and click OK
3. Save the file somewhere, call it `my_first_rmd.Rmd`
4. Click the *Knit HTML* button
5. Watch the progress in the R Markdown pane, then gaze upon your result!

You may also open up the file in your computer's browser if you so desire, using the *Open in Browser* button at the top of the preview window.

---

# R Markdown Headers

The header of an .Rmd file is a [YAML](http://yaml.org/) (YAML Ain't Markup Language&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) code block, and everything else is part of the main document.

.footnote[[1] Nerds love recursive acronyms.
 ]
--

```{}
---
title: "Untitled"
author: "Charles Lanfear"
date: "March 28, 2018"
output: html_document
---
```
--

To mess with global formatting, [you can modify the header](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/html_document_format.html)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

.footnote[[2] Be careful though, YAML is space-sensitive; indents matter!]

```{}
output:
  html_document:
    theme: readable
```

# R Markdown Tinkering

Try tinkering with `my_first_rmd.Rmd` to give it some pizzazz: Add sections, have it number the sections, make a list, throw in the UW logo, change the theme, insert a gratuitous equation.

# Formatting Caveats

To keep R Markdown dead-simple, it lacks some features you might occasionally want to use. Your options for fancier documents are:

* Use HTML with CSS for custom formatting&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
* Use LaTeX and .Rnw files instead of .Rmd&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

For day-to-day use, plain vanilla R Markdown does the job.

For handouts, memos, and homeworks, default R Markdown PDFs look surprisingly good!


.footnote[

# R Code in R Markdown

Inside RMarkdown, lines of R code are called **chunks**. Code is sandwiched between sets of three backticks and `{r}`. This chunk of code...

    ```{r}
    data(cars)
    summary(cars)
    ```
Produces this output in your document:

```r
data(cars)
summary(cars)
```

```
##      speed           dist       
##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

---


# Chunk Options

Chunks have options that control what happens with their code, such as:

* `echo=FALSE`: Keeps R code from being shown in the document

* `eval=FALSE`: Show R code in the document without running it

* `include=FALSE`: Hides all output but still runs code (good for `setup` chunks where you load packages!)

* `results='hide'`: Hides R's (non-plot) output from the document

* `cache=TRUE`: Saves results of running that chunk so if it takes a while, you won't have to re-run it each time you re-knit the document

* `fig.height=5, fig.width=5`: modify the dimensions of any plots that are generated in the chunk (units are in inches)


Some of these can be modified using the gear-shaped *Modify Chunk Options* button in each chunk. [There are a *lot* of other options, however](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/).

---

# Playing with Chunk Options

Try adding or changing the chunk options (separated by commas) for the two chunks in `my_first_Rmd.Rmd` and re-knitting to check what happens.


You can also name your chunks by putting something after the `r` before the chunk options.

    ```{r summarize_cars, echo=FALSE}
    summary(cars)
    ```
After you name your chunks, look what happens in the dropdown on the bottom left of your editor pane.

Naming chunks allows you to browse through an RMarkdown document by named chunks. 

You can also browse by sections named using headers and subheaders.

---

# In-Line R code

Sometimes we want to insert a value directly into our text. We do that using code in single backticks starting off with `r`.
--




    Four score and seven years ago is the same as `r 4*20 + 7` years.
--
Four score and seven years ago is the same as 87 years.

--

Maybe we've saved a variable in a chunk we want to reference in the text:


```r
x &lt;- sqrt(77) # &lt;- is how we assign variables
```
--

    The value of `x` rounded to the nearest two decimals is `r round(x, 2)`.
--
The value of `x` rounded to the nearest two decimals is 8.77.

---

# This is Amazing!

Having R dump values directly into your document protects you from silly mistakes:

--

* Never wonder "how did I come up with this quantity?" ever again: Just look at your formula in your .Rmd file!

--

* Consistency! No "find/replace" mishaps; reference a variable in-line throughout your document without manually updating if the calculation changes (e.g. reporting sample sizes).

--

* You are more likely to make a typo in a "hard-coded" number than you are to write R code that somehow runs but gives you the wrong thing.

---

# Example: Keeping Dates

In your YAML header, make the date come from R's `Sys.time()` function by changing:

    date: "March 30, 2016"
to:

    date: "`r Sys.time()`"
Fancier option: Use this instead to take today's date and make it read nicely:

    date: `format(Sys.Date(), format="%B %d, %Y")`

# Data Frames

---

# What's Up with `cars`?

In the sample R Markdown document you are working on, we can load the built-in data
`cars`, which loads as a dataframe, a type of object mentioned earlier. Then, we can look at it in a couple different ways.

--

`data(cars)` loads this dataframe into the **Global Environment** (as a *promise*&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

.footnote[[1] Promises are *unevaluated arguments*. Read more about R's [lazy evaluation here](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functions.html).]

--

`View(cars)` pops up a **Viewer** pane ("interactive" use only, don't put in R Markdown document!) or...
--


```r
head(cars, 5) # prints first 5 rows, see tail() too
```

```
##   speed dist
## 1     4    2
## 2     4   10
## 3     7    4
## 4     7   22
## 5     8   16
```



---

# Tell Me More About `cars`

`str()` displays the structure of an object:

```r
str(cars) # str[ucture]
```

```
## 'data.frame':	50 obs. of  2 variables:
##  $ speed: num  4 4 7 7 8 9 10 10 10 11 ...
##  $ dist : num  2 10 4 22 16 10 18 26 34 17 ...
```

--

`summary()` displays summary information&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:

```r
summary(cars)
```

```
##      speed           dist       
##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

# Ugly Pictures of `cars`

`hist()` generates a histogram of a vector.

# `swiss` Time

Let's switch gears to the `swiss` data frame built in to R.

--

First, use `?swiss` to see what things mean.

--

Then, load it using `data(swiss)`

--

Add chunks to your R Markdown document inspecting swiss, defining variables, doing some exploratory plots using hist or plot. You can experiment with [colors](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf) and [shapes](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Shapes_and_line_types/).

---

## Looking at `swiss`


```r
pairs(swiss, pch = 8, col = "violet",
      main = "Pairwise comparisons of Swiss variables")
```

# Installing Packages

Let's make a table that looks a little less code-y in the output. To do this, we'll 
want to install a **package** called `pander`. Packages contain premade functions 
and/or data we can use. R's strength is its wide variety of packages!

In the console: `install.packages("pander")`.

--

* Note that unlike the `library()` command, *the name of a package to be installed must be in quotes*. This is because the name here is a search term (text, not an object!) while for `library()` it is an actual R object.

--

* Once you install a package, you don't need to re-install it until you update R. *Consequently, you should not include* `install.packages()` *in any markdown document or R script!*

---

# Making Tables


```r
library(pander) # loads pander, do once in your session
pander(summary(swiss), style = "rmarkdown", split.tables = 120)
```

# Homework

Write up a .Rmd file showing some exploratory analyses of the Swiss fertility data. Upload both the `.Rmd` file and the `.html` file to Canvas. You must upload *both* for credit.

Mix in-line R calculations, tables, R output, and plots with text describing the relationships you see. Include *at least* one plot and one table. You are encouraged to include more! You must use in-line R calculations/references at least once (e.g. with functions like `nrow()`, `mean()`, `sd()`, `cor()`, `median()`, `min()`, `quantile()`) and *may not hard-code any numbers referenced in your text*.

Your document should be pleasant for a peer to look at, with some organization using sections or lists, and all plots labeled clearly. Use chunk options `echo` and `results` to limit the code/output you show in the .html. Discussion of specific values should be summarized in sentences in your text---*not as printed code and output*---and rounded so as not to be absurdly precise (e.g. round `x` with `round(x, 2)`).
