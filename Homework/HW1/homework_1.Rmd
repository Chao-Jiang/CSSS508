Write up a .Rmd file showing some exploratory analyses of the Swiss fertility data. Upload both the .Rmd file and the .html file to Canvas.

Mix in-line R calculations, tables, R output, and plots with text describing the relationships you see. You must use in-line R calculations/references at least once (e.g. with functions like `nrow`, `mean`, `sd`, `cor`, `median`, `min`, `quantile`) and *may not hard-code any numbers referenced in your text*.

Your document should be pleasant for a peer to look at, with some organization using sections or lists, and all plots labeled clearly. Use chunk options `echo` and `results` to limit the code/output you show in the .html. Discussion of specific values should be summarized in sentences in your text--*not as printed code and output*--and rounded so as not to be absurdly precise.
