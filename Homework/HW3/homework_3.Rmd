Pick something to look at in the `nycflights13` data and write up a .Rmd file showing your investigation. Upload both the .Rmd file and the .html file to Canvas. You must use at least once: `mutate`, `summarize`, `group_by`, and joins. *Include at least one formatted plot or table* (use "nice" variable names and rounded values).

This time, *include all your code in your output document*, using comments and line breaks separating commands so that it is clear to a peer what you are doing. You must write up your observations in words as well.
